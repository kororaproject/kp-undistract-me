%description
Some commands take ages to run!
You're doing some work, and as part of that you need to run a command on the
terminal that takes a little while to finish. Perhaps it's your test suite,
your build process, or an unusually big data run.

Watching commands is boring!
You run the command, watch it for maybe a second and then switch to doing
something elseâ€”answering email or something more useful and fun than staring
at a terminal.

Time flies when you're distracted!
You get so deeply involved in your email that twenty minutes fly by. When you
switch back to your terminal the command has finished, but you've got no idea
whether it was nineteen seconds ago or nineteen minutes ago.

Undistract me, please!
This happens to me a lot. I'm not prescient enough to predict which commands
will take a long time, and I'm not disciplined to add something to the end of
each one. If you are like me, then what we both need is something that alerts
us whenever long running commands finish.

This is it!
